# Tools
A various toolkit created for niche uses. Each project should live in its own `www/<project>/` subdirectory and must be an `npm` project, which must employ a `build` script to build the project. Webpack is recommended, as it is already setup for other projects. Anything under the `www/<project>/src/` directory will be removed upon web deployment.
